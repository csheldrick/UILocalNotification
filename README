This is a drop in category for apps that use UILocalNotifications. 
When using local notifications you must specify the Badge (the number that will display when the alert is fired) there is no built-in way to increment the badge. 
With this category all you have to do is call [UILocalNotifications setBadge]; after you change any of the notifications. 
This will pull all notifications and set the badge number accordingly, you will also want to call this method in your app delegate. 
By calling this method everytime your app is launched, you will be reordering the badges since the previous ones have already fired. A simple but helpful category to add a feature that should have already been in place.
